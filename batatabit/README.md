## Technologies Used

The BatataBit frontend project utilizes the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts (DM Sans, Inter)
- SVG icons for visual elements
- Responsive design techniques

## Mobile-First Approach

This project adopts a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices. The layout and styles are initially designed for mobile devices and are enhanced for larger screens using media queries.

## Media Queries

Media queries are employed to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The `tablet.css` file contains specific styles for tablets, adjusting the layout and spacing for an optimal viewing experience.

## Design Tricks

### Color Scheme

The project uses a well-thought-out color scheme to create a visually appealing interface:

- Bitcoin Orange: #F7931A
- Soft Orange: #FFE9D5
- Secondary Blue: #1A9AF7
- Soft Blue: #E7F5FF
- Warm Black: #201E1C
- Black: #282623
- Grey: #BABABA
- Off-White: #FAF8F7
- Just White: #FFFFFF

### Typography

Two Google Fonts, DM Sans and Inter, are combined to provide a modern and readable typography throughout the project.
