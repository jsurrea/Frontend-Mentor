## CSS Features Utilized

### Fonts and Styling

- **Custom Font**: The project utilizes the 'Beau Rivage' font from Google Fonts for the title, adding a unique and stylized look.

### Animation

- **Bunny Animation**: The bunny element features a subtle hide-and-seek animation using the `@keyframes` rule, creating a playful movement effect.

- **Eye Blinking Animation**: The eyes of the bunny blink at regular intervals, showcasing the use of keyframe animations for dynamic visual elements.

### Layout and Positioning

- **Layered Structure**: The project uses a layered structure with absolute positioning to create a visually interesting composition.

- **Phone Frame**: The phone frame is created using CSS, applying borders, border-radius, and box-shadow for a realistic and appealing appearance.

- **Dynamic Wall Placement**: Walls are dynamically positioned using CSS variables, demonstrating the flexibility of layout design.

### Checkbox Interaction

- **Checkbox Counter**: The project utilizes the `counter` and `counter-increment` properties to count the number of bunnies caught, providing an interactive element to the user *without any Javascript!*.

- **Pause Animation on Checkbox**: The bunny's animation state is paused when the checkbox is checked, showcasing the interaction between CSS and user input.

### Drawing and Styling

- **Bunny Styling**: The bunny is styled using CSS variables for colors, demonstrating the power of custom properties for easy theme adjustments.
  
- **Grassy Lawn Drawing**: The grassy lawn is created with CSS, featuring a visually appealing design using multiple layers and pseudo-elements.

### Stack Context

- **Z-Index Usage**: The project employs the `z-index` property for layer stacking, ensuring proper visual hierarchy in the composition.

### Responsive Design

- **Viewport Meta Tag**: The project includes a viewport meta tag for responsive design, ensuring proper scaling on various devices.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to experience AnimationLand.
3. Catch bunnies by clicking the checkbox and watch the interactive animations.

Feel free to explore the CSS files (`game.css`, `bunny.css`, `wall.css`, `lawn.css`, `layout.css`) to delve deeper into the implementation details and learn from the code.

> Happy coding and bunny-catching in AnimationLand! 🐰✨
